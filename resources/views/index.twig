        <h1>Google Shared Contacts manager</h1>

        <p>
            On most Google Apps domains, the only shared contact details between users are the users themselves;
            you can always find your colleagues in your phone's or email application's autocomplete feature.
        </p>

        <p>
            A less known feature is called "shared contacts". Any arbitrary contact can be added to the "shared
            contacts" so everybody within the domain can see these people's details. This can be extremely useful, since
            it allows you to share client's information, external company details and other people many of your
            colleagues might come in contact with.
        </p>

        <p>
            This small tool allows you to manage the shared contacts in your Google Apps domain.
            You can read more about <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/60218?hl=en">shared contacts on this
                Google help page</a>.

            This tool does not save data locally. Any data received is only stored in your session
            and in the current request.
        </p>

        <p>
            To use this tool, make sure you are logged in and have Administrator rights on your
            Google Apps domain. This tool does <strong>not</strong> work for @gmail.com addresses!
